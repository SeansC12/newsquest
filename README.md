Newsquest is a one-stop news site where the user can view news articles published on all major journalist websites. It uses a News API to fetch from all these different sources. It also gamifies the experience by keeping track of user points, which are incremented by reading a news article.

# Tech Stack
- Next.js
- Supabase
- MySQL (but uses Sqlite deployed on Turso for the production version so it is free)
- TailwindCSS
